# Improvement Changelog

Each entry: what changed, and the evidence that drove the decision (a trace, a failing test, a metric, a judge-visible constraint). Filled in from kickoff onward.

## 2026-08-27: pre-kickoff harness

Built `harness/trace.py`, `test_harness.py`, `run.sh`, and the submission templates before the problem PDF (the document describing what to actually build) was published. This was done first because a trajectory, the full step-by-step record of what an agent run actually did, cannot be put together after the fact. It has to be captured live, while the run is happening. Evidence: competition deliverable 4 requires trajectories "from the agent instructions through to the final result." Without a logger already running before the first real agent run, that run's trajectory would be lost for good. See `PRE-EXISTING.md`.

## 2026-08-29: evaluation-set harvest

Built `harvest.py`, `baselines/regex_rule.py`, `test_harvest.py`, and wired a `harvest` subcommand into `run.sh`. Gated by contrarian plan-review PASS at loop 3 of 3 (change_id `prslop-harvest-2026-08-29`), which found and fixed 7 binding conditions before any code was written, most importantly: `created_at` was still in the allow-list and turned out to be an 8x to 30x open-duration leak in disguise (86.2% AUC, removed); the frozen closing-reference pattern did not actually capture owner/repo, so the cross-repo carve-out could not have worked; a third declaration form (`owner/repo#N`) was missing from the pattern; `changed_files` and `patch` are not obtainable from the raw pull object as originally written (`changed_files` there is an integer count, not a file list).

Evidence from the real harvest run: the frozen pattern re-derives the bucket census as 23/54/23 on the true 100-most-recently-closed pull requests, against the earlier, narrower rule's 15/74/11 (condition E; both numbers are in `data/manifest.json`). The no-model reference rule that reads the (now-stripped) declared-link field directly scores 66.7% balanced accuracy by construction (`baselines/regex_rule.py`), which is the size of the leak the strip closes. All 15 harvested cases pass the allow-list, forbidden-field, and zero-surviving-match tests (`test_harvest.py`, 14/14), including the positive control that at least one case's redacted reference used the URL or shorthand form and not just bare `#N`.
