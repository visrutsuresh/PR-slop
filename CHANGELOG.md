# Improvement Changelog

Each entry: what changed, and the evidence that drove the decision (a trace, a failing test, a metric, a judge-visible constraint). Filled in from kickoff onward.

## 2026-08-27: pre-kickoff harness

Built `harness/trace.py`, `test_harness.py`, `run.sh`, and the submission templates before the problem PDF (the document describing what to actually build) was published. This was done first because a trajectory, the full step-by-step record of what an agent run actually did, cannot be put together after the fact. It has to be captured live, while the run is happening. Evidence: competition deliverable 4 requires trajectories "from the agent instructions through to the final result." Without a logger already running before the first real agent run, that run's trajectory would be lost for good. See `PRE-EXISTING.md`.

<!-- TODO: one entry per meaningful iteration from kickoff onward. -->
